This project demonstrates:

- Automated EDA and customizable visualizations for quick, interactive insights
- Options for handling missing data, scaling numerical features, and transforming categorical columns
- An interactive interface built with Streamlit for easy file upload and feature selection
- Real-time updates on data preprocessing steps

## Key Features:

- Customizable EDA: Automatically generate insights, handle missing data, and transform columns with ease.
- Data Preprocessing: A suite of preprocessing options to clean and prepare data efficiently.
- Visualization Options: Choose from multiple visualization types to best represent your data.
- Data Restoration: Revert to the original dataset with a single click, ensuring flexibility.

## Installation and Setup:

Get started quickly by following these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TawfiqMohammed/AutoGraph.git
cd AutoGraph
```

2. Install dependencies: Ensure you have Streamlit and other required packages installed.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch AutoGraph:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## Usage Guide
1. Upload a CSV file: Upload your dataset or select the example Titanic dataset from the sidebar.
    
2. Explore EDA: 

    - View Statistics: Generate and display summary statistics for your dataset, including count, mean, min, max, and standard deviation.

    - Visualize Distributions: Create histograms, box plots, and density plots to analyze the distribution of numerical features.

    - Analyze Relationships: Use scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.

    - Categorical Analysis: Generate count plots to examine the distribution of categorical variables.

3. Preprocessing Dataset:

    - Handle Missing Data: Remove rows with missing data or fill missing values in numerical columns (using mean, median, or mode).

    - Transform Columns: Normalize numerical features and encode categorical variables.

    - Restore Data: Revert to the original dataset if needed.

4. Export & Share: Download your cleaned dataset and visualizations for further use.
